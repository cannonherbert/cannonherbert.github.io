This blog post is a little late.  Why do I want to learn software development?  The more accurate question would be why do I want to continue learning.  I really began my journey into computer programming 10 years ago when I was a freshman in high school.  Building things in Visual Basic was fun and rewarding.  Then I learned how to work with Java and C++, but they didn't take to me quite as quickly.  Our class didn't really have a great teacher for those courses, leaving me to feeling like I could never become a serious computer programmer. 

Over the years I've had many career goals.  Law, engineering and writing just to name a few.  None of these choices felt like the correct path for me.  I stagnated, working at Wawa for three years, slowly sinking into a pit of self loathing and feeling unfulfilled.  I watched as people came and went, each one achieving their own goals.  What made me different?  Why was I stuck at a dead end?

One day an ad popped up on my newsfeed for App Academy's bootcamp prep.  I took the online program and graduated a month earlier than they predicted.  I couldn't get enough time coding.  The fear of never being good at programming vanished.  I knew this is what I was meant to do with my life. I want to make a career out of programming because I love to do it.  I find it fun and relaxing.  I love building things that people can use to make their lives better.
